# Hi, I'm Lucas!

Welcome to my GitHub profile, I'm a software developer, violinist, and an ultra-runner.

## About Me

- 🎓 **Background**: I am currently pursuing a part-time Masters of Science in CS at Georgia Tech and have experience across multiple languages like Java, Ruby, C, Python, and more.
- 🎻 **Passion for Music**: Playing music has always been a huge part of my life. I have degrees in Music, three published solo and chamber music CDs, and have performed professionally across the USA.
- 🏃‍♂️ **Running Enthusiast**: I also enjoy staying active, especially through running long distances and on trails.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

- **[Sudoku Solver w/ UI](https://github.com/LucasHTMartins/sudoku-solver-Ui)**: A sudoku solver program I built which features a user interface and several bits of functionality, like pre-stored sudoku boards.
- **[Six Degrees of Hollywood](https://github.com/LucasHTMartins/Six-Degrees-of-Hollywood)**: A project that uses IMDB data and the TMDB API to find and visualize the shortest connection between any two actors, directors, or composers within Hollywood.
- **[Cesar Cipher Decoder](https://github.com/LucasHTMartins/Cesar-cipher-cracker-Ui)**: An interactive tool for encoding, decoding, and cracking messages using the Cesar Cipher, enhanced by an algorithm that analyzes letter frequency to decrypt any coded text into plain English.
